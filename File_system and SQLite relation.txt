When we take an image using expo camera, the expo stores the image in a temporary storage (cache).
For that reason when we close the app the image will erase from its cache. So we need to store the
image on a permanent storage. By default each project in an expo app has a dedicated file system
for it. Inside that file system there is a local file system. Inside that local file system there is
a "Document Directory" it can store an image permanently. For that reason we need to store the image
in that "Document Directory" using expo file system.

When we create a database using "SQLite.openDatabase()", by default the database is created to the
"Document Directory". So we can easily take the image path from the "Document Directory" and easily
store it to an attribute of a table of the database.
